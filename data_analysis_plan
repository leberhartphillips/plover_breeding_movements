Data analysis plan

A) assess sex-differences in the amount of movements during the breeding season
  - subset all datasets to the local breeding season period

B) detect nesting activity with movement data
 - prospective methods:
  - time-dependent step-length
    - Rational: when a given sex is on the nest, the distance between consecutive fixes
      will be small and attributed mainly to GPS error.
    - i) Methodoligical steps to determine the statistical "signature" of nesting: 
        1) link known nesting locations and timing to GPS data sets
        2) subset GPS datasets to the time each nest was known to be active
        3) for each dataset calculate the:
          a) distance between each fix and the nest
          b) step-length between fixes
          c) ALDE (autocorrelated kernel density estimation)
        4) facet each of the three metrics by circadian windows reflective of
          presumed sexroles durign incubation
    - ii) Methodological steps to determine unknown nesting attempts:
        1) subset all datasets to the local breeding season period
        2) remove the timeperiods of nesting determined in (i) above
        3) visulize results and compare to the patterns shown in (i)

c) Assess spatial use during brood-care
  - wrangling steps:
    - extract all GPS tracking data from periods of known brood-care DONE
      - subset tagging data to family_IDs with brood observations DONE
    - extract all GPS tracking data from periods of potential brood-care DONE
      - subset tagging data to nests that were determined as "Hatched" and the
      end_date < than the last_fix DONE
    - in both of the above datasets, attempt to standardize the data given the
    varied temporal resolution of the datasets (e.g., downsample to time of day 
    that is most common across datasets)
    
  - analytical steps:
    - for known broods, assess 1) cumulative distance trav
