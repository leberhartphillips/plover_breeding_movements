Data analysis plan

A) assess sex-differences in the amount of movements during the breeding season
  - subset all datasets to the local breeding season period

B) detect nesting activity with movement data
 - prospective methods:
  - time-dependent step-length
    - Rational: when a given sex is on the nest, the distance between consecutive fixes
      will be small and attributed mainly to GPS error.
    - Methodoligical steps: 
      1) link known nesting locations and timing to GPS data sets
      2) subset GPS datasets to the time each nest was known to be active
      3) for each dataset calculate the:
        a) distance between each fix and the nest
        b) step-length between fixes
        c) ALDE (autocorrelated kernel density estimation)
