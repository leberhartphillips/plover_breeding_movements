Data analysis plan

A) assess sex-differences in the amount of movements during the breeding season
  - subset all datasets to the local breeding season period

B) detect nesting activity with movement data
 - prospective methods:
  - time-dependent step-length
    - Rational: when a given sex is on the nest, the distance between consecutive fixes
      will be small and attributed mainly to GPS error.
    - i) Methodoligical steps to determine the statistical "signature" of nesting: 
        1) link known nesting locations and timing to GPS data sets
        2) subset GPS datasets to the time each nest was known to be active
        3) for each dataset calculate the:
          a) distance between each fix and the nest
          b) step-length between fixes
          c) ALDE (autocorrelated kernel density estimation)
        4) facet each of the three metrics by circadian windows reflective of
          presumed sexroles durign incubation
    - ii) Methodological steps to determine unknown nesting attempts:
        1) subset all datasets to the local breeding season period
        2) remove the timeperiods of nesting determined in (i) above
        3) visulize results and compare to the patterns shown in (i)
