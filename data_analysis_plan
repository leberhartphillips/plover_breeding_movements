Data analysis plan

A) assess sex-differences in the amount of movements during the breeding season
  - subset all datasets to the local breeding season period

B) detect nesting activity with movement data
 - prospective methods:
  - time-dependent step-length
    - Rational: when a given sex is on the nest, the distance between consecutive fixes
      will be small and attributed mainly to GPS error.
    - i) Methodoligical steps to determine the statistical "signature" of nesting: 
        1) link known nesting locations and timing to GPS data sets
        2) subset GPS datasets to the time each nest was known to be active
        3) for each dataset calculate the:
          a) distance between each fix and the nest
          b) step-length between fixes
          c) 
          (autocorrelated kernel density estimation)
        4) facet each of the three metrics by circadian windows reflective of
          presumed sexroles durign incubation
    - ii) Methodological steps to determine unknown nesting attempts:
        1) subset all datasets to the local breeding season period
        2) remove the timeperiods of nesting determined in (i) above
        3) visulize results and compare to the patterns shown in (i)

c) Assess spatial use during brood-care
  - wrangling steps:
    - extract all GPS tracking data from periods of known brood-care DONE
      - subset tagging data to family_IDs with brood observations DONE
    - extract all GPS tracking data from periods of potential brood-care DONE
      - subset tagging data to nests that were determined as "Hatched" and the
      end_date < than the last_fix DONE
    - in both of the above datasets, attempt to standardize the data given the
    varied temporal resolution of the datasets (e.g., downsample to time of day 
    that is most common across datasets)
    
  - analytical steps:
    - for known broods, assess 1) cumulative distance trav
    
d) recursive analysis
  - identify areas that have high fidelity within a given radius (i.e., 
  measurement error of GPS device): these are presumable nesting attempts
  - determine the number of days that the bird was using a high fidelity area
  - determine the timespan that the bird was using the high fidelity area (i.e,
  exit_date - start_date)
  
  getRecursions object gives:
  1) coordIdx =  the index of the focal coordinate into the data frame (either 
  the movement trajectory or the list of specified locations)
  2) visitIdx = The visitIdx gives the index of which visit this is to the focal 
  coordinate (so the number of revisits corresponds to the highest visit index)
  3) entranceTime and exitTime = the times calculated for crossing the radius by 
  interpolating between the points inside and outside the radius
  4 timeSinceLastVist = calculated as the time outside the radius between visits 
  for subsequent visits
  
  - wrangling approach:
  
  
  - potential extra steps to explore:
    - use "getRecursionsInPolygon" function to first identify potential nesting
    habitat.

potential issues:
-  (DONE) BX.RM|OX.YX female has repeated combo (end date of SNPL_2022_A_2 overlaps start date of SNPL_2022_D_211)

- where was MX.RW|YX.LX (F) between 2018-05-07 and 2018-06-27?
- where was OX.RM|GX.GX (F) between 2019-05-19 and 2019-06-16?
- OX.RM|WX.GX male has repeated combo with female (end date of SNPL_2022_C_201 overlaps start date of SNPL_2022_E_3)
- OX.RM|WX.GX (F): end date of SNPL_2022_C_201 overlaps with start date of SNPL_2022_D_205
